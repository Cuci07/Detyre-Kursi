# Blockchain Report

## Introduction
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology used for securely recording transactions. 
It is widely applied in finance, supply chain, and data security. 
The core components of blockchain include cryptographic hashing, consensus mechanisms, and decentralized verification.

## Objectives
The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand the basic principles of blockchain.
- Implement a simple blockchain in Python.
- Demonstrate a consensus mechanism (Proof of Work).
- Validate blockchain integrity.

## Implementation
The blockchain is implemented using Python, featuring:
- **Block Structure**: Each block contains an index, timestamp, transaction data, previous block hash, and a nonce for Proof of Work.
- **Blockchain Management**: A class to handle block addition, mining, and validation.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A computational puzzle that ensures security and decentralization.

### Code Structure
1. **Block Class**: Defines block attributes and hashing function.
2. **Blockchain Class**: Manages the chain, adds blocks, and verifies integrity.
3. **Proof of Work**: Adjusts difficulty and ensures valid mining.

## Results
- The blockchain successfully adds and validates blocks.
- Proof of Work ensures security by requiring computational effort to mine blocks.
- The chain integrity check confirms that data remains unaltered.

## Applications
Blockchain technology has various real-world applications, including:
- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin and Ethereum use blockchain for decentralized finance.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Ensures transparency and traceability.
- **Digital Identity**: Secure authentication and verification.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a simplified blockchain and Proof of Work. 
Future improvements may include implementing Proof of Stake, smart contracts, and peer-to-peer networking for a more robust blockchain system.
